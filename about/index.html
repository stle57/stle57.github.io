	<h1>Hi there, I'm Stephanie T. Le!</h1>
	<p>As you can see, I'm trying to learn how to use GitHub more, as well as other modern languages within a technology stack.  I'm a busy mom, trying to keep up with my family,
  but I want to stay current and be able to apply what I'm learning to new and interesting projects.  Hopefully, it might score me a new gig, but we'll leave all that information
  out of here.  I'm just a software girl trying to build something interesting.  What is that thing?  I don't know yet.  Stay tuned to find out!</a></p>
